# Demo Content

### The Content
During the "Assemble Extra Components" step there are extra options to
set up demo and default content. If you're on the public version of Rocketship,
please ignore the talk about "Features"; These aren't in (yet!).


#### Default Content
Rocketship Core can set up the homepage, 404 and 403 if you choose to enable
the Rocketship Content module. There is no need to uninstall this module again
as this type of content is classified as "default content". A small kickstart
so you don't have to do it yourself.

Most Features' Basic versions will also migrate and create a custom content
block with an Overview Paragraph showing their frontpage Views. This block
will automatically be placed on the frontpage (using Migrates, Layout Builder and other dark magic).
Feel free to throw these away if not needed, or change their positions, or do whatever is
required.


#### Demo Content
Rocketship Core can also set up a demo page with all the types of Paragraphs.
This module does need to be uninstalled before going live or showing a client,
as this is specifically demo content. This can be used for estimations, to get
some content in the site for styling purposes, or for Sales teams to show
prospectives what Rocketship can do out of the box.

Each Feature now also has Demo Content modules. Again, these are not meant to be
put on live, so if you select one or more of these modules do not forget to also
uninstall them when you no longer need the demo content. Uninstalling a demo
content module will roll back the migrations.

If a feature has both a Basic and Advanced version, they'll have two Demo
modules. You can enable both at the same time with no issue if you'd like a
larger amount of content, but generally speaking you'd only pick the one for
the version of the Feature you're installing. Basic Demo Content if the client
only requested the Core or Basic version of the Feature and the Advanced Demo
Content if the client requested the Advanced version of the Feature.


#### Demo Theme
Rocketship now also has a Demo Theme. This is *only* meant for Demo purposes,
it is pre-styled specifically for the Demo Content modules and is **NOT** to be
used as a base theme for further development!
